Join us for our next Action Hour where we will discuss current events, share the status of various efforts, and write to our state legislators. Margaret Coppe will be joining us to discuss the proposed expansion at Hanscom and provide us with the latest updates. There will be no postcard packets at this meeting so we can sit back, relax, and build community. Please [RSVP](https://mobilize.us/s/zasZrf) so that we know that you are 

Meet us at Via Lago in Lexington Center. Feel free to bring a friend, just stop by to say hello, or pickup postcard packets even if you canâ€™t stay.
