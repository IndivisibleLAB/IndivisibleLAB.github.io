The mission of IndivisibleLAB (Lexington, Arlington, Bedford, and Beyond) is to provide a home for local activists to come together to take collective action at the local, state, and federal level; build community; have some laughs; and recharge. We plan to partner with nearby Indivisible groups to amplify their actions (e.g., postcarding, texting, nomination papers, etc.) that focus on legislative, voter registration, and get out the vote efforts.

Members of our Indivisible Guide chapter come from all kinds of backgrounds and political persuasions. Some of us are first-time activists and other have been at this for decades. We are citizens and noncitizens. Most importantly, we are all patriots that want the best for our country and are willing to work for it.

**All are welcome.**
