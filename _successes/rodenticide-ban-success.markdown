In an effort to support the Rodenticide Bill (i.e. H.4600), Indivisible LAB decided to create bookmarks to distribute at the IndivisiGather event on June 26. The bookmarks contain full color photos of owls from Arlington (unfortunately lost due to rodenticide), a bill number, and a QR code sending people to our resource sheet. Not only were 60 book marks handed out at the event, but many conversations happened to educate people on the devastating effects of rodenticide. This project also let us connect with people in the community, the State Rep sponsoring the legislation, and our own elected officials.
