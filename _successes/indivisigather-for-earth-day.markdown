On April 26th, we had a great IndivisiGathering in Lexington Center. We went to Center Goods to learn about the plastic crisis and ways to buy products that have no plastic packaging.  We followed up the shop tour with refreshments at Via Lago. We all left with a great take away bag containing plastic-free products! Thanks National for supporting groups.
