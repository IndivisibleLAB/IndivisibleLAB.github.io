On March 29, we had a great action hour! Margaret Coppe attended and provided us with an informative presentation about the proposed expansion at Hanscom. There are many reasons to oppose this expansion - noise, the amount of pollution that would be given off by the private planes, the effect on the neighbors, and more. We appreciated being updated on the latest status of the project.
