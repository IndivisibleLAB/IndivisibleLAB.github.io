We were thrilled that 30 people came to learn about the problems caused by SGAR (rodenticide), alternatives, and legislative action. Laura Kiesel and Gary Menin provided fantastic background information about the issue. Gary brought an excellent show and tell of alternatives. Rep Hawkins provided information about the bills at the state house. And to top it off Diane Welch and her friend Rita brought a red tail hawk!
