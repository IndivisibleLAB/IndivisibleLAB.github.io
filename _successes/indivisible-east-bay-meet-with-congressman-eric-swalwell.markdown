IndivisibleLAB was at Sundayâ€™s IndivisiGather in Worcester along with the more than 100 attendees who helped build enthusiasm and momentum for the months ahead.

Most of those who attended were motivated by the midterm elections and agreed that a fortified democracy was the most popular vision of what success looks like in 2023. 

We even got a photo with Ezra!
