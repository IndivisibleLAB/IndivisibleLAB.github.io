Join us to help pass the [Fair Share Amendment](https://www.fairsharema.com/why-fair-share) - Question 1 on our November ballots - which will raise dedicated funds for education and transportation from a 4 percent tax on a person’s annual income above $1 million.

IndivisibleLAB members have been canvassing, phone banking, and tabling at local Farmers Markets to talk to voters about the Fair Share amendment. You can find an updated list of events in our area to Get Out the Vote for Question 1, including canvasses in Arlington, Belmont, and Lexington, [HERE](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/?org_ids=32944) or in other locations across the state [HERE](https://www.mobilize.us/fairshareamendment2022/).
