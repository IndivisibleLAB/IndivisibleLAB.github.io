Join us for our next Action Hour in Lexington! You'll receive details about the location in your confirmation email after you [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/570058/).

On January 10, we’ll be discussing [*The Persuaders: At the Front Lines of the Fight for Hearts, Minds, and Democracy*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-persuaders-at-the-front-lines-of-the-fight-for-hearts-minds-and-democracy-anand-giridharadas/20131017?ean=9780593312643) by Anand Giridharadas. The book highlights the stories of activists, politicians, educators, and everyday citizens working to change minds, bridge divisions, and fight for democracy. Indivisible members across the country will also be reading this book and the author will join Indivisibles [via Zoom](https://indivisible.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrdO2rpzkqHdWcqY_JCuxIjIGYNQy1zNem#/registration) on January 25. 

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on. We all learn from each other!
