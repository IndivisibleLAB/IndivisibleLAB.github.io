Join us for our next Action Hour in Lexington. Now that the weather is getting colder, we'll be meeting indoors. You'll receive details about the location in your confirmation email after you [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/570058/).

Erin Leahy, the Executive Director of [Act On Mass](https://actonmass.org/), will join us to tell us about their Sunlight Agenda to bring more transparency to the MA State House. Massachusetts has an image of a progressive blue state. Yet we have the least transparent state government in the country, where the Governor's office, the Judiciary, and the State Legislature all claim exemptions to the public records law. Act On Mass is a grassroots 501(c)(4) organization fighting for good government and transparency. 

We won't have postcards at this event, but will have [ballot petitions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ap6m9zA6kbL5Hime7DdXjqoypsQTaUVPC8zqMbX8WYU/edit?usp=sharing) to sign and a bin to collect donations for Indivisible Mass Coalition's [40 bin project](https://mcusercontent.com/448f2617a0ea6d2c20e5c403c/files/b6dd9d89-3cbc-3e44-eeee-6505abf7ccdc/40_Days_of_REAL_Help.pdf) to support women and reproductive healthcare. Thank you for dropping off any of the following items: Tylenol, ibuprofen, heating pads, individually wrapped tampons and pads or packages of tampons and pads; gift cards in any amount for Target or CVS; mittens, hats, socks.

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on. We all learn from each other!
