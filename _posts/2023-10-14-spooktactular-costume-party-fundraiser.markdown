IndivisibleLAB is cosponsoring Indivisible Acton Areaâ€™s SPOOKTACULAR costume party FUNdraiser. There will be refreshments, music, dancing and prizes for the most notable costumes. Please come laugh, dance, and socialize while fundraising for [Act on Mass](https://actonmass.org/), a non-profit organization fighting for transparency and good governance at the MA State House. Let's celebrate all our hard work this year!
