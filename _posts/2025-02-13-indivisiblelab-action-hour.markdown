Join us for our Winter Action Hours which will be held at an indoor location in Lexington near Route 2. As usual, we'll discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on - we all learn from each other!

We apologize that we're not able to accept any more signups for our in-person meeting on February 19, but you can still signup to pick up postcard packets for the Wisconsin Supreme Court race or a special election for a US House seat in Florida in Concord [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8b6QeFaQT_AVXQ0Y1My05SoM9ifahfMIKMmqaWG7fOQGzXA/viewform)

Please RSVP to get location details and parking information for our March meetings.
