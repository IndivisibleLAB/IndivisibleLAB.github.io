Join us for our Winter Action Hours which will be held at an indoor location in Lexington near Route 2. As usual, we'll discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. 

A volunteer from the Lexington Refugee Assistance Program (LexRAP) will join us to discuss the serious situation refugee families face locally and what they need from citizen allies.

You can also sign up to get postcard packets for the Wisconsin Supreme Court race or a special election for a US House seat in Florida [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8b6QeFaQT_AVXQ0Y1My05SoM9ifahfMIKMmqaWG7fOQGzXA/viewform)

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on - we all learn from each other! Please RSVP to get location details and parking information.
