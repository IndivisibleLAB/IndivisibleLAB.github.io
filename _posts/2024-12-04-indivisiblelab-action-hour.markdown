Join us for an informal get-together and invite friends! Share some holiday refreshments and your thoughts on actions we can take together in 2025.

Now, more than ever, it’s important to maintain our connections with each other and not lose sight of the power of our community.

As usual, we will be meeting at an indoor location in Lexington near Route 2. Please RSVP to get location details and parking information.
