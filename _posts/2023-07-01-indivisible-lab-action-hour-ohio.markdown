Join us for our next Action Hour at Lexington Visitor Center (tables in the back), where we will write to turn out Democratic voters to vote “no” on the Republican-led referendum scheduled for August 8. The referendum will increase the threshold to pass a citizen-led constitutional amendment from a simple majority to 60%.  Its immediate goal is to defeat a November citizen-led initiative to protect reasonable abortion rights.  Longer-term, the Ohio Republicans hope the higher vote threshold will defeat future efforts to provide equal funding for education, fair wages and many other policies supported by a majority of Ohioans. 

This campaign complements the Ohio Democratic Party efforts to reach likely Democrats who vote in primaries by sending postcards to the people they do not believe they will reach by canvass or phone. The postcards will ensure that recipients know there is an election on August 8, that they know to vote NO, and that they have the details about the new Ohio ID requirements for voting. Join us to protect democracy in Ohio! Join us to protect reproductive rights and abortion in Ohio! Sign up today! 

Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (Cards, stamps, printed labels, instructions, and in-kind contribution form.) These cards are to be mailed as soon as possible with a final mailing date of July 25. Reimbursement is $20. Please [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/569779/) and let us know how many packets we should reserve.
