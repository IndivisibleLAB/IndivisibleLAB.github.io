Join us for a casual, two-way conversation with Rep. Ciccolo and Rep. Gordon to learn about their priorities for this legislative session. This is a chance to hear about the bills that Ciccolo and Gordon are most focused on and for us to share what bills are most important to us. Please [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/569296/) so that we know that you are coming.
