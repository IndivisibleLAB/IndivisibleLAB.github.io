Join us for our next Action Hour. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and have some laughs.

On February 7, we’ll be writing postcards to unregistered likely Democrats in Erie County, an “island of blue” in red, rural northwest Pennsylvania ([MAFlipPA](https://www.maflippa.org/) Postcard Campaign). Even postcards returned due to wrong addresses or deceased or moved recipients are not wasted because local volunteers will use the returns to clean up the voter files to avoid wasted effort in future voter contacts.

We will have special guests from [MAFlipPA](https://www.maflippa.org/), Bob Scheier and Ann Eldridge, who will tell us what's at stake in PA, key races and current prospects for them, and what MAFlipPA is doing with specific action opportunities.

Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (Cards, stamps, printed labels, and instructions). Reimbursement is $15. Please [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/570058/) and let us know how many packets to reserve. 

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on. We all learn from each other!
