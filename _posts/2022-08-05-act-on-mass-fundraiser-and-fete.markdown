Join us and fellow local Indivisibles at this fun event to:
Celebrate and Support Act on Mass - The Indivisible Acton Steering committee has created a matching fund of $7,000! Theyâ€™ve partnered with Act on Mass from the beginning, and although admiring what the organization has done on a shoestring budget, we want to help them be strong for the upcoming rules votes in January. 

Fete Vivian Tseng, a member of the IAA steering committee who is moving to Malden. A lifelong activist, Vivian will be celebrating with her Indivisible and Malden friends as she prepares to move.

Please RSVP.
