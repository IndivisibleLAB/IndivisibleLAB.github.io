Join us for our next Action Hour at the Lexington Visitor Center (tables on the patio in the back). As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and have some laughs.

On September 27, we will have another Virginia postcard campaign and will announce the details soon. Please [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/570058/) and let us know how many packets to reserve.  

Please feel free to come and share anything you are working on. We all learn from each other!
