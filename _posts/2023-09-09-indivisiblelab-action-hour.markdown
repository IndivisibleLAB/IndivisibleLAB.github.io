Join us for our next Action Hour at the Lexington Visitor Center (tables on the patio in the back). As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and have some laughs.

We have a big push for postcards/letters in October! Now is the time for all hands on deck before the critical November 7 elections in Virginia and Ohio.

On October 11, we will distribute/write Working America GOTV letters for VA and Indivisible OH  Pro-Choice postcard campaigns. We also have a few VA packets from our previous campaigns. Please [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/570058/) and let us know how many packets to reserve.

Working America is targeting Virginia members because they believe the state has some key learnings on what we can expect from the political landscape heading into 2024.Â The letters provide members with critical information about how to and pressure on why to vote. They are using this light pressure because when individuals know their peers, friends, and neighbors participate in the democratic process, they are more likely to do the same. These letters convey that voting isn't just a civic duty; it's a shared responsibility and a means to influence the future collectively.

Each packet has everything you need to send 20 letters (Pre-printed letters, addresses, #10 envelope, return label, and first-class stamps.) Reimbursement is $13.50 per packet.

Indivisible National has provided us Ohio Pro-Choice postcards at no cost. Anyone writing for the Working America letter or VA postcard campaign will also receive a free OH packet. Each packet contains everything you need to write 20 postcards (cards, stamps, labels, and [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/121XadD8XtVtx_BHsKbGc3AV41hOhNJgE9hVnPXjidoc/edit?usp=sharing)).

We will also have ballot petitions to sign and a bin to collect donations for IMC's 40 bin project to support women and reproductive healthcare. Thank you for dropping off any of the following items: Tylenol, ibuprofen, heating pads, individually wrapped tampons and pads or packages of tampons and pads; gift cards in any amount for Target or CVS; mittens, hats, socks.

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on. We all learn from each other!
