Join us for our next Action Hour at the Lexington Visitor Center (tables on the patio in the back). As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and have some laughs.

On September 27, we will write postcards asking women to support [Kimberly Pope Adams](https://kimadamsforva.com/), a Democrat running in Virginia HD 82 - Petersburg - a tossup district. It is important we reach out to women because Virginia is the last southern state where abortion is still safe and legal.


All of the seats in the VA state legislature are up for election on November 7, 2023.  Democrats currently hold a slim majority in the VA State Senate.  We are working to hold the State Senate and win back the State House of Delegates.  

Each packet will contain everything you need to write and send 25 postcards (postcards, stamps, address labels, voting information stickers, and [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iqXQLXb2LYTI7CggJr4mb8RGQOrNO-jF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106112089057037951056&rtpof=true&sd=true)). The cards should be mailed as written with the final mail by date of October 20. Reimbursement is $15 per packet. Please [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/570058/) and let us know how many packets to reserve.  

[Mara Dolan](https://maradolan.com/), who is running for [Governor's Council](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/governors-council) in 2024, will be joining us. "The Governor’s Council has never had a public defender to help us decide who our judges are going to be, who sits on our Parole Board, and who receives commutations and pardons. We need to make that right, and we can do that this year."  If elected, Mara will be the only public defender on the Governor's Council.

We will also have additional [Ballot Initiative Petitions to sign](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/582499/). Please feel free to come and share anything you are working on. We all learn from each other!
