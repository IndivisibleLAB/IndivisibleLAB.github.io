Join us for our next Action Hour in Lexington. Now that the weather is getting colder, we'll be meeting indoors and will post an RSVP form with more details soon. 

We won't have postcards at this event, but are planning to have a special guest to discuss why it's so difficult to pass legislation at the State House. 

We will also have ballot petitions to sign and a bin to collect donations for Indivisible Mass Coalitions's [40 bin project](https://mcusercontent.com/448f2617a0ea6d2c20e5c403c/files/b6dd9d89-3cbc-3e44-eeee-6505abf7ccdc/40_Days_of_REAL_Help.pdf) to support women and reproductive healthcare. Thank you for dropping off any of the following items: Tylenol, ibuprofen, heating pads, individually wrapped tampons and pads or packages of tampons and pads; gift cards in any amount for Target or CVS; mittens, hats, socks.

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on. We all learn from each other!
