Indivisible Mass Coalition’s Feminist Action Team is asking people to send two postcards or emails: one to their State Senator and one to their State Representative to ask that they cosponsor An Act Enhancing Abortion Access, [S.1114](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/SD1854)/[H.1599](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/H1599) and An Act Protecting Patient Privacy and Preventing Unfair and Deceptive Practices [S.174](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/S174)/[H.377](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/H377). These bills target the deceptive practices of the more than 30 anti-abortion [“Crisis Pregnancy Centers”](https://msmagazine.com/2023/08/08/fake-abortion-clinics-crisis-pregnancy-centers/) in MA. Learn more about the work MA Indivisible groups are doing to expose these fake clinics [HERE](https://indivisible-ma.org/mass-indivisiblog/).

We’ll have the postcards at our Action Hours every other Wednesday at 10:30. If you can’t attend an Action Hour, please email or use your own postcards to contact your state legislators. Some of our state reps (Cataldo, Ciccolo, Gentile) have already signed on to co-sponsor H.1599, but not H.377, and Senators Barrett, Eldridge, and Friedman have not co-sponsored either Senate bill.
