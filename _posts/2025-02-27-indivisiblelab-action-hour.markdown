Join us for our Winter Action Hours at our new location in Lexington Center. As usual, we'll discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. 

On March 5, our guest speaker will discuss executive orders targeting transgender people and families. We will also be collecting donations of underwear and menstrual products for Dignity Matters (get more information [here](https://www.dignity-matters.org/donate-products/)

Please RSVP to get location details and parking information. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on - we all learn from each other!
