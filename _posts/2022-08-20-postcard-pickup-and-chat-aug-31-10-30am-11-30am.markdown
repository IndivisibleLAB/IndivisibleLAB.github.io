Meet us outside at the visitor center in Lexington. And feel free to bring a friend and/or just stop by to say hello and/or pickup postcard packets even if you canâ€™t stay. You will find us at the picnic tables in front or the porch in the back (depending on weather). We spread out tables but feel free to bring a mask; we can also create a mask-only table if there is demand.
If you want a drink or snack, check out Via Lago, which is just across Meriam Street. There is parking on the street or in the lot on Meriam Street. There is a water refill station inside the Visitor Center so bring your own water bottle!
