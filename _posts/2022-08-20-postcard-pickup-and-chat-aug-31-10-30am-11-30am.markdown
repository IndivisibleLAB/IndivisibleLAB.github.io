Join the movement to elect pro-choice Democrats! The extremist Supreme Court has taken away our freedom and right to abortion. [Activate America](https://www.activateamerica.vote/) is writing to voters in swing states who are likely pro-choice with a simple message: your freedom is being curtailed, fight back and vote. For this event, we will be writing for [Chris Deluzio (PA 17)](https://chrisforpa.com/). Chris is a Pittsburgh-area native, an Iraq War Veteran, and a voting rights attorney. Packets contain everything you need to write 20 postcards; the cost is $10. Please mail postcards as you complete them, and by September 10 at the latest.

Meet us outside at the visitor center in Lexington. Feel free to bring a friend, just stop by to say hello, or pickup postcard packets even if you can’t stay. You’ll find us at the picnic tables in front or the porch in the back (depending on weather). We spread out tables but feel free to bring a mask; we can also create a mask-only table if there is demand.

If you want a drink or snack, check out Via Lago, which is just across Meriam Street. There is parking on the street or in the lot on Meriam Street. There is a water refill station inside the Visitor Center so bring your own water bottle!
