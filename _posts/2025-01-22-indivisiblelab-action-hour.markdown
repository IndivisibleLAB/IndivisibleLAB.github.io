Join us for our Winter Action Hours which will be held at an indoor location in Lexington near Route 2. We all learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on.

On February 5, we will be talking about how to protect vulnerable people, both in the short term and long term. If you would like to pick up postcard packets for the WI Supreme Court election, please sign up [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAMnETQQCEoIllwy80gj7HHfil7TP5-Io4koEv_C83jqjMzQ/viewform).

Please RSVP to get location details and parking information.
