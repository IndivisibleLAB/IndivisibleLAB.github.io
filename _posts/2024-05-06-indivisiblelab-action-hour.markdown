Join us for our next Action Hour in Lexington. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and learn from each other. See the RSVP link for location details

On May 15, we will be hosting a postcard-writing party. Please pick up a packet, grab a cup of coffee and pastry, and write for democracy! 

We’ll have pens, colored markers, white-out tapes, and everything else we need to write cards for campaigns in AZ, CA, and WI. Get more details about the postcard campaigns and [sign up for packets here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfD0kWEv-dZ69JI_ZlaPgwA311b79Bfl7-LK725r1KB9LNXJA/viewform).

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve. 

Our discussion of David Pepper’s book “Saving Democracy” has been postponed until our May 29th Action Hour. 

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!
