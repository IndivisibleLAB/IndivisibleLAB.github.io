Join us at the State House for the Progressive Mass Lobby Day to discuss key bills with your legislators, especially ones on affordable housing, criminal legal reform, and climate action. 

Whether you've lobbied before or are lobbying for the first time, Progressive Mass will make sure that you’re well-prepared for meetings with your state legislators. 

If you'd like to carpool from Lexington, email us at IndivisibleLAB@gmail.com and indicate whether you're interested in getting a ride or driving others.
