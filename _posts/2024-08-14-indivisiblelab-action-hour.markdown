This September we will be holding our Action Hours on the patio behind the Lexington Visitor Center. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets and discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. We’ll be announcing our next postcard campaign here soon.

At this Action Hour, speakers will discuss two questions that will appear on MA ballots this November: [Question 3](https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Question_3,_Unionization_and_Collective_Bargaining_for_Transportation_Network_Drivers_Initiative_(2024)), which would provide for unionization and collective bargaining for transportation network drivers like Uber and Lyft, and [Question 4](https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Question_4,_Regulated_Access_to_Psychedelic_Substances_Initiative_(2024)), which would regulate access to psychedelic substances.

This week, we also have two postcard campaigns to chose from. You can write postcards to AZ to encourage likely Democrats to register to vote to elect Kamala Harris and support a state legislative candidate, or to CA  voters to help flip a congressional seat in a district Biden won by over 10%. Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (cards, stamps, printed labels, and instructions). Reimbursement is $15. Get more details (including mail-by dates, links to scripts, and multiple pickup options) and [sign up for packets here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSetlsO0PBr8vT3qvNc3kGdVCI48_hsDrXsc3Fr83mwM-HFKHA/viewform).

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve. In the event of bad weather, we'll notify you about an alternate indoor location nearby.

We all learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!
