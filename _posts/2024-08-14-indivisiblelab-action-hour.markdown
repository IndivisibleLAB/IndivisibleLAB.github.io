This September we will be holding our Action Hours on the patio behind the Lexington Visitor Center. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets and discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. 

This week, weâ€™re hosting a speaker from the local group [All in for NC](https://swingbluealliance.org/northcarolina/) and will have two postcard campaigns to chose from: one to encourage likely Democrats in NC to register to vote and another to provide information to Northeast Arizona Native Democrats. 

Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (cards, stamps, addresses and instructions). Reimbursement is $15. Get more details (including mail-by dates, links to scripts, and multiple pickup options) and [sign up for packets here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAbLrMLWqJISKW4CflNuCdwpNxGNVesDsqQFWNEh542cODrQ/viewform).

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve. In the event of bad weather, we'll notify you about an alternate indoor location nearby.

We all learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!
