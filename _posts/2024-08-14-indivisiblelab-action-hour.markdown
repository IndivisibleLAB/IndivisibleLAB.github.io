This September we will be holding our Action Hours on the patio behind the Lexington Visitor Center. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets and discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. Weâ€™ll be announcing our next postcard campaign here soon.

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve. In the event of bad weather, we'll notify you about an alternate indoor location nearby.

We all learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!
