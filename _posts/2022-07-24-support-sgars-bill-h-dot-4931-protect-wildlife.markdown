The MA House of Representatives Passed An Act Relative to Pesticides. Please call your state Senator and ask them to reach out to the Senate Committee on Ways and Means to get this bill passed in the MA Senate this session (which ends July 31st)! The bill seeks to monitor and reduce the use of Second-Generate Anticoagulant Rodenticides (SGARs) in the Commonwealth to protect our wildlife and pets. For more information see our Resource Sheet:
