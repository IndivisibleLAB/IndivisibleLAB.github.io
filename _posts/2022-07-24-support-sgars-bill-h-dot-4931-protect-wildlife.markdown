Another owl in Arlington has died of rodenticide. This is heartbreaking. We need to make progress on the problem of rodenticide.

The MA House of Representatives Passed An Act Relative to Pesticides. This bill has been stuck in the Senate Ways and Means committee. It is still possible to pass this bill in the informal session.  Please call Senate leadership about the Rodenticide Bill (H.4931). The bill seeks to monitor and reduce the use of Second-Generate Anticoagulant Rodenticides (SGARs) in the Commonwealth to protect our wildlife and pets. Here is the contact information for leadership:
President - karenspilka@masenate.gov 617.722.1500
Chair of Senate Ways and Means - michael.rodrigues@masenate.gov 617.722.1114
