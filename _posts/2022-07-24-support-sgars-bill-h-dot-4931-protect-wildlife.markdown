The MA House of Representatives Passed An Act Relative to Pesticides. This bill did not get through the Senate before the end of the session BUT we are hopeful that it will pass in an informal session. Please call your state Senator and ask them to support the Rodenticide Bill (H.4931). The bill seeks to monitor and reduce the use of Second-Generate Anticoagulant Rodenticides (SGARs) in the Commonwealth to protect our wildlife and pets.
