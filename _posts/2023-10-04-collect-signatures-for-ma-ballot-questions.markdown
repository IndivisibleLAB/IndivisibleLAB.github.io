IndivisibleLAB members are collecting signatures to help get several questions on the MA ballot in 2024 including ones to:
* Allow same day voter registration in MA
Phase in the full minimum wage for tipped workers
Clarify that the State Auditor can audit the State Legislature
Remove MCAS as a graduation requirement 
Restore voting rights for incarcerated people 

On Tuesday afternoons, we’ll be collecting signatures at the Worthen Road entrance to the Lexington Farmers Market and would love to have you join us! Most volunteers stay for an hour (or longer), but any amount of time you can spend is appreciated! We’re usually there from 2-5, but may be able to arrange other time slots. Sign up [HERE](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/582499/) and we’ll email you to confirm what time(s) work best for you. 

Can’t join us at the Farmers Market? We can provide sheets that you can use to collect signatures on your own. Even if you can only get a handful of signatures from family or friends, that’s a big help as campaigns must collect almost 75,000 signatures from registered voters by Nov. 22 to be on the ballot next year! 

If you’d like to collect signatures on your own, fill out our form at [bit.ly/GetBallotSheets](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScD4kHKsYYyytG1RsvAePOi-PXvSjLzq_Ya6d-VS2oWGCj2pQ/viewform) to indicate which question(s) you’d like sheets for and whether you want to pick them up at the Farmers Market, at our biweekly Action Hours on Wednesday mornings in Lexington Center, or make other arrangements.
