Join us at the State House for the Progressive Mass Lobby Day to connect with fellow activists from across MA and discuss key bills with your legislators. 

Whether you've lobbied before or are lobbying for the first time, Progressive Mass will make sure that you’re well-prepared for meetings with your state legislators.
