The labor movement, immigrants rights groups, and a large coalition of other organizations including Indivisible and 50501 are organizing a Day of Action on May 1, a traditional day to celebrate and honor the contributions of working people. 

This May Day, join us to demand fair wages, accessible healthcare, safe housing, strong unions, and protections for allâ€”regardless of race, immigration status, or income. 

Indivisible LAB is co-sponsoring the May Day protest in Lexington along with several other organizations including Lexington Alarm, the Lexington Democratic Town Committee, Minutewomen for Democracy, Wednesday Protest Team, and Lexington Hands Off.

Bring a sign and stand with us by the Minuteman Statue on Thursday, May 1 anytime between 4:30 and 6:30pm. Nonviolence is a core principle of this action - all participants should help de-escalate any potential confrontation and uphold a peaceful, respectful presence.

You can register [HERE](https://www.mobilize.us/mayday/event/780672/), but drop-ins are also welcome.

There are also rallies and standouts planned in Boston, and in nearby communities including Bedford and Waltham.
