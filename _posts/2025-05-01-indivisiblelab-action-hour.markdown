Join us for our Spring Action Hours at our new location in Lexington Center. As usual, we'll discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. Please RSVP to get location details and parking information.

On May 14th, Enid Eckstein - founding member of Boston’s JP Progressives and longtime organizer with Raise Up Massachusetts - will join us to talk about the upcoming lobby day at the State House on May 28 sponsored by Progressive Mass. We’ll discuss key bills, meetings with legislators, and transportation options. Regardless of your experience with state politics, there will be lots to learn and share!

On May 28, instead of our usual local Action Hour, we’ll be joining the Progressive Mass Lobby Day at the State House. We’ll be sharing information about carpool options later in May, but in the meantime, you can sign up to join us at the Lobby Day [HERE](https://actionnetwork.org/events/progressive-mass-2025-lobby-day).

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on - we all learn from each other!
