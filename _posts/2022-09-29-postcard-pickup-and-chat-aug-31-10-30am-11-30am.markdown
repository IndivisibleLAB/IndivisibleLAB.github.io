Meet us outside at the visitor center in Lexington for what might be our final postcard event before the mid-terms. Feel free to bring a friend, just stop by to say hello, or pickup postcard packets even if you can’t stay. You’ll find us on the porch in the back or at the picnic tables in front (depending on weather). We spread out tables but feel free to bring a mask; we can also create a mask-only table if there is demand.

This week, we are joining the New Hampshire Rural Freedom Network to write cards with a pro-choice message supporting Senator Maggie Hassan. MAGA is targeting New Hampshire, and these seats are very important to protect. New Hampshire has very restrictive voting laws- no early voting at all. That means we need to mobilize our voters for election day on November 8th. Details: mail as you write, finish by Oct 19; packets contain 30 postcards, address labels, stamps, and instructions; very short (8 words max) script (and they give you a choice!); reimbursement is $15 per packet.

If you want a drink or snack, check out Via Lago, which is just across Meriam Street. There is parking on the street or in the lot on Meriam Street. There is a water refill station inside the Visitor Center so bring your own water bottle!
