Meet us outside at the visitor center in Lexington. Feel free to bring a friend, just stop by to say hello, or pickup postcard packets even if you can’t stay. You’ll find us at the picnic tables in front or the porch in the back (depending on weather). We spread out tables but feel free to bring a mask; we can also create a mask-only table if there is demand.

We'll post details about the postcards we'll be writing and a link to reserve postcard packets soon!

If you want a drink or snack, check out Via Lago, which is just across Meriam Street. There is parking on the street or in the lot on Meriam Street. There is a water refill station inside the Visitor Center so bring your own water bottle!
