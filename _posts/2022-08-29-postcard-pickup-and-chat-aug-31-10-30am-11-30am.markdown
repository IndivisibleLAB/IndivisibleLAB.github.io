Meet us outside at the visitor center in Lexington. Feel free to bring a friend, just stop by to say hello, or pickup postcard packets even if you can’t stay. You’ll find us on the porch in the back or at the picnic tables in front (depending on weather). We spread out tables but feel free to bring a mask; we can also create a mask-only table if there is demand.

This week's campaign supports Christy Clark, a Democrat in the swing state of North Carolina. Christy is a small business founder, educator, gun-safety advocate, and parent. She served in the NC House from 2019-2020 and is running to reclaim her seat from a Republican in the NCGOP leadership. A win in this district would be a bulwark against a GOP supermajority in the NC House, where 3 seats will make the difference. Christy is running an amazing campaign powered by an enthusiastic group of local volunteers. These postcards are an important way to reinforce the face-to-face and door-to-door work Christy’s campaign is doing. Each packet contains everything you need to write 25 postcards; the price is $15. 

If you want a drink or snack, check out Via Lago, which is just across Meriam Street. There is parking on the street or in the lot on Meriam Street. There is a water refill station inside the Visitor Center so bring your own water bottle!

Can't join us this time? We'll be having similar events every other Wednesday at the same time and location through October.
