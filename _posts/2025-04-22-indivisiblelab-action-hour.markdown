Join us for our Spring Action Hours at our new location in Lexington Center. As usual, we'll discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. 

We’ll be posting details about the plans for our May 14 Action Hour here soon.  

Please RSVP to get location details and parking information. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on - we all learn from each other!

On May 28, instead of our usual local Action Hour, we’ll be joining the Progressive Mass Lobby Day at the State House. We’ll be sharing information about carpool options later in May, but in the meantime, you can sign up to join us at the Lobby Day [HERE](https://actionnetwork.org/events/progressive-mass-2025-lobby-day).
