Looking ahead to November, we need to build our resilience! So, join us for a community happy hour where you can connect with others, have fun, and build community. 

In October, we will again be at Burton's Grill in Burlington. Thanks to Indivisible National, IndivisibleLAB will supply the non-alcoholic drinks and appetizers / small plates. Attendees will be responsible for their own alcoholic drinks. This event is just social - no speakers and no postcards! RSVP [here](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/630370/)
