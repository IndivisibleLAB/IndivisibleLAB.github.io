Join us for our next Action Hour at the Lexington Visitor Center (tables on the patio in the back). As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and have some laughs.

On August 30, we will be writing Swing Blue Alliance postcards to support [Jade Harris for the VA State Senate](https://www.jadeharrisva.com/). She has made supporting reproductive choice, expanding mental health care, repealing right-to-work laws, strengthening unions, and supporting local farmers among her priorities. She is a 2020 graduate of Mary Baldwin University and has been an organizer for March for Our Lives and worked on voter registration drives.

Currently, Democrats have a narrow majority in the State Senate. We can’t take it for granted though – it’s the only brake on radical Republicans led by Gov. Youngkin. Since all seats come up for election at the same time, it’s really important to work on the state legislature. Rural voters hold under-recognized power to influence the outcome of elections for the US Senate and the Electoral College. One of the important ways we can help our democracy get on track is to take back state legislatures by driving up rural voter participation.

Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (Cards, stamps, printed labels, and instructions). Hold and Mail these cards on Oct 2, 2023. Reimbursement is $18. Please [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/570058/) and let us know how many packets to reserve.

We will also discuss our humongous plastics problem and Indivisible Mass Coalition's Feminist Action Team's [campaign](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUPSQ5I9AS-Umcg5P3N-EcUxoCCK2JeIFlNhJJ4dx6w/edit?usp=sharing) to send two postcards to our legislators to protect reproductive rights. Please feel free to come and share anything you are working on. We all learn from each other!
