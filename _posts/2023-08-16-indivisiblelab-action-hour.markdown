Join us for our next Action Hour at the Lexington Visitor Center (tables on the patio in the back). As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and have some laughs.

On September 13, we will write postcards to unregistered likely Democrats in Pennsylvania with MA Flip PA. These addresses in Schuylkill County and Lehigh County come from the national database of Field Team 6. MA Flip PA's partners in PA  will follow up by canvassing to ensure these prospects register and VOTE!

Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (Cards, stamps, printed labels, and instructions). There is no fixed deadline for mailing these postcards, but the deadline for registering to vote this year is October 23 - We will need these voters in 2024 for the Presidential and Senate races. Reimbursement is $15. We will also have some Swing Blue Alliance postcards to support Jade Harris for the VA State Senate - Reimbursement is $18. Please [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/570058/) and let us know how many packets to reserve.  

Please feel free to come and share anything you are working on. We all learn from each other!
