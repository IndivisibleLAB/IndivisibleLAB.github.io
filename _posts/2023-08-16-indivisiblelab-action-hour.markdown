Join us for our next Action Hour at the Lexington Visitor Center (tables on the patio in the back). As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and have some laughs.

We’ll be announcing our next postcard campaign here soon. Please [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/570058/) so that we know to expect you and how many packets to reserve.

We will also be discussing efforts to support reproductive choice in MA and other local and state issues. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on. We all learn from each other!
