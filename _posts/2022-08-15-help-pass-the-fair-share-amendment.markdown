The [Fair Share Amendment](https://www.fairsharema.com/why-fair-share) - Question 1 on our November ballots - will create a 4 percent tax on a person’s annual income above $1 million and dedicate the funds raised to transportation and public education.

IndivisibleLAB members have been canvassing, phone banking, and tabling at local Farmers Markets to talk to voters about the Fair Share amendment.
