Join us for our next Action Hour. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and have some laughs. See the RSVP link for location.

We will write postcards to unregistered likely Democrats in Michigan’s 7th district, one of the most competitive in the nation and rated a “tossup” by Ballotpedia. While Democrat Elissa Slotkin won by 5.4% in 2022 in this district that Biden won by 0.5%, she is now running for the US Senate, which we also need to keep blue.

Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (Cards, stamps, printed labels, and instructions). Reimbursement is $15. Please [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/570058/) and let us know how many packets to reserve.  

We will also be discussing an important local initiative. Lexington Town Meeting will be voting this spring on whether the town should designate a parcel of  land it owns for new affordable housing and authorize a call for bids to developers. 

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on. We all learn from each other!
