Join us for our next Action Hour. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and learn from each other. See the RSVP link for location. 

The intersection of national, regional, and local politics—always critically important— has become more and more apparent in the last eight years. How does that fact affect campaigns in 2024? Jonathan Cohn, [Progressive Mass](https://www.progressivemass.com/) Policy Director and contributor to The Boston Globe, Commonwealth Magazine, WGBH, and other outlets, will speak about that and about key state legislation at our April 3 Action Hour.

We’ll be announcing our next postcard campaign here soon. Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve.

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!
