Join us for our next Action Hour. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and learn from each other. See the RSVP link for location. 

Susan Labandibar from [Swing Blue Alliance](https://swingbluealliance.org/) will review the political landscape in battleground states, summarize the latest research on effective tactics, and discuss ways that we can take action in 2024!

We’ll be announcing our next Arizona postcard campaign here soon. Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve.

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!
