Join us for our next Action Hour on May 1 when we'll be discussing key races in Wisconsin and opportunities to get involved through Indivisible, Field Team 6, and the Wisconsin Democratic Party! See the RSVP link for location.

We’ll also have postcards for two campaigns: additional packets supporting [Democrat Will Rollins in CA-41](https://willrollinsforcongress.com/) as well as postcards to encourage likely Democrats in the [WI-03 Congressional District](https://ballotpedia.org/Wisconsin%27s_3rd_Congressional_District) to register to vote in a district that flipped from Democrat to Republican in 2022. 

Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (Cards, stamps, printed labels, and instructions). Reimbursement is $15. 

[See details for both campaigns and reserve packets HERE.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZbwdM-anx_M8Ypuh1aP5rOQ-oqZl5wjPnNSDdOMGv0rjzzA/viewform)

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve.

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on! We all learn from each other.
