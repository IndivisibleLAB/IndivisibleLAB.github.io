Join us for our next Action Hour. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and learn from each other. See the RSVP link for location. 

Jonathan Cohn, Policy Director at [Progressive Mass](https://www.progressivemass.com/), will discuss state issues, including key bills, ballot questions, and elections. While much of our attention and effort may be focused on the federal elections this fall, there are also important decisions legislators and citizens will be making right here in MA.

We’ll be announcing our next postcard campaign here soon. Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve.

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!
