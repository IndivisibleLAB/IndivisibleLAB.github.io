Join us for our next Action Hour. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and have some laughs. See the RSVP link for location.

At our March 6 Action Hour, we will write voter registration postcards to unregistered likely Democrats in PA. Pennsylvania remains a critical state in the U.S. Presidential, House, and Senate elections. At the state level, Democrats are working to expand their majority in the House and gain ground in the Senate, where vulnerable GOP state Senators are up for reelection. People who vote in the Primary are much more likely to vote in November. Lets get people registered to vote for the PA primary on April 23.

Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (Cards, stamps, printed labels, and [instructions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10ySXoRHQOC7C2kbi6n3NU9mfJPLzJC3b/view?usp=sharing)). Reimbursement is $15. Please RSVP and let us know how many packets to reserve.

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on. We all learn from each other!
