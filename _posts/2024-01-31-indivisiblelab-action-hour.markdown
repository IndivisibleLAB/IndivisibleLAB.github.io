Join us for our next Action Hour. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and learn from each other. See the RSVP link for location. 

We’ll distribute postcard packets for Arizona CD-06, one of Indivisible’s “[Unrepresentative](https://www.unrepresentative18.org/reps)” districts. Democrats have a strong candidate, Kirsten Engel, who came close to winning in 2022. The postcards will go to registered Democrats who do not always vote. The script has a reproductive rights message, as polling shows reproductive freedom is an important issue for Democratic voters in Arizona.

Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (Cards, stamps, printed labels, and [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14R9yH78HanpfOlubg6FvoZ5i9XuHwTrZZpIXkPkkiIU/edit?usp=sharing)). Reimbursement is $15.

We'll also have a special guest! Susan Labandibar from [Swing Blue Alliance](https://swingbluealliance.org/) will review the political landscape in battleground states, summarize the latest research on effective tactics, and discuss ways that we can take action in 2024!

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve.

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!
