Nobody wants mice in their house or rats running around their town BUT the current use of rodenticide (rat poison) has many terrible side effects, including the death of many wild animals (raptors, fox, coyotes, squirrels, etc.) and some domestic pets (cats and dogs). The wild animals that are killed are often nature’s best rodent controllers, which can actually make the rat population worse. The really sad part is that there are alternatives to rodenticide.

Save Lexington Wildlife and IndivisibleLAB are pleased to host “Rodent Control: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly”. This presentation will cover why rodenticide is dangerous to wildlife and pets, other products and methods that one can use to control unwanted rodents, and information on an article that Save Lexington Wildlife is bringing to town meeting.

Presenters include:
- Laura Kiesel, M. Sc. Natural Resources Sciences and Management & environmental journalist, founder of [Save Arlington Wildlife](https://savearlingtonwildlife.org).
- Gary Menin, Sr., former local representative for Raptors are the Solution (RATS), [Talkin’ Birds](https://www.talkinbirds.com) Ambassador, and an advocate for keeping our raptors poison free.
- Marci Cemenska, Founder of [Save Lexington Wildlife](https://savelexingtonwildlife.org/).

Please join us for this interactive presentation on February 17, 2024 at Lexington Community Center, room 242 from 2:30-4:00 pm. Please RSVP here https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/596111/
