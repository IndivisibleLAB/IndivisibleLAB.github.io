Join us for our Winter Action Hours which will be held at an indoor location in Lexington near Route 2. As usual, we will discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy.

We all learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on.

Please RSVP to get location details and parking information.
