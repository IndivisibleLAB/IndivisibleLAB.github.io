Join us for our Winter Action Hours!

On January 8, we'll be discussing ["On Tyranny"](https://timothysnyder.org/on-tyranny) by Timothy Snyder and how we can apply the 20 lessons in his book to take action in 2025.

As usual, we will be meeting at an indoor location in Lexington near Route 2. Please RSVP to get location details and parking information.

We all learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!
