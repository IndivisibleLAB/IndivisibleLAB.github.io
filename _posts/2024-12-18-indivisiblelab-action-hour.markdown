Join us for our Winter Action Hours which will be held at an indoor location in Lexington near Route 2. 

On January 22, we will continue our discussion of the 20 important lessons for saving democracy in Timothy Snyder's book [On Tyranny](https://turnpurple2blue.org/2025/01/08/the-new-opposition-for-2025-concrete-steps-you-can-take/). We will also discuss proposals from Indivisible, Swing Blue Alliance, and other activist organizations for specific actions we can take.

We all learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on.

Please RSVP to get location details and parking information.
