Join us for our Winter Action Hours which will be held at an indoor location in Lexington near Route 2. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on - we all learn from each other!

On February 5, our topic will be protecting vulnerable people—both now and in the long term. What actions do we need to take and support? Come and learn what we can do and exchange information about resources and vital actions underway.

In addition, postcard packets for the critically important WI Supreme Court election will be available to pick up. Please sign up for postcard packets [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAMnETQQCEoIllwy80gj7HHfil7TP5-Io4koEv_C83jqjMzQ/viewform).

Please RSVP to get location details and parking information.
