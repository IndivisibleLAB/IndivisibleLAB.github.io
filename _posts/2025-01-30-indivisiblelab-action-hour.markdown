Join us for our Winter Action Hours which will be held at an indoor location in Lexington near Route 2. As usual, we'll discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on - we all learn from each other! Please RSVP to get location details and parking information.
