Join us at the next IndivisibleLAB Action Hour where we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and write to our legislators. 

Meet us at Via Lago in Lexington Center. Feel free to bring a friend, just stop by to say hello, or pickup postcard packets even if you canâ€™t stay. 

Please RSVP and include the number of packets you would like: https://mobilize.us/s/hgAbvp****
