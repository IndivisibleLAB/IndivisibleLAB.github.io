Join us for our Winter Action Hours at our new location in Lexington Center. As usual, we'll discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. 

On March 19, [Andrea Park](https://www.mlri.org/staff-member/andrea-m-park/), who is the Director of Community Driven Advocacy for the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute ([MLRI](https://www.mlri.org/)) and Kelly Turley, the Associate Director of the [Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless](https://www.mahomeless.org/), will discuss the shelter crisis in Massachusetts, the implications of recent changes to the family shelter policy, and the actions we can all take to protect vulnerable families. “We all do better when we all do better” - Paul Wellstone

Please RSVP to get location details and parking information. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on - we all learn from each other!
