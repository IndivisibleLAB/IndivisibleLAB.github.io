Nobody wants mice in their house or rats running around their town BUT the current use of rodenticide (rat poison) has many terrible side effects, including the death of many wild animals (raptors, fox, coyotes, squirrels, etc.) and some domestic pets (cats and dogs). The wild animals that are killed are often nature’s best rodent controllers, which can actually make the rat population worse. The really sad part is that there are alternatives to rodenticide.

IndivisibleLAB is pleased to host  “Rodent Control: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly”. This presentation will cover why rodenticide is dangerous to wildlife and pets, other products and methods that one can use to control unwanted rodents, and legislative action that one can take to help in our community.

Stay tuned for more information.

Please join us for this interactive presentation on February 11, 2023 at Lexington Community Center, room 242 from 2:30-4:00 pm. Note: masks are required.
