Join us for our next Action Hour in Lexington! You'll receive details about the location in your confirmation email after you [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/570058/).

On December 13, Christine Brown will tell us about effective strategies for political donations - including organizations to donate to as well as timing. Let’s make the most of our donation dollars to support pro-democracy candidates up and down the ballot. Christine is a founder of [Turn Purple 2 Blue](https://turnpurple2blue.org/) and a steering committee member of [Indivisible Acton Area](http://www.indivisibleacton.org/).  

We will also be giving away several copies of the book [*The Persuaders: At the Front Lines of the Fight for Hearts, Minds, and Democracy*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-persuaders-at-the-front-lines-of-the-fight-for-hearts-minds-and-democracy-anand-giridharadas/20131017?ean=9780593312643) by Anand Giridharadas in preparation for our book discussion on January 10. The book highlights the stories of activists, politicians, educators, and everyday citizens working to change minds, bridge divisions, and fight for democracy.

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on. We all learn from each other!
