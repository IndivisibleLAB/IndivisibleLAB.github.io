Join us for our next Action Hour in Lexington. Now that the weather is getting colder, we'll be meeting indoors. You'll receive details about the location in your confirmation email after you [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/570058/).

On November 29, a representative from [Stop Private Jet Expansion at Hanscom or Anywhere](https://www.stopprivatejetexpansion.org/) will join us to discuss the campaign and answer your questions. We’ll also have postcards you can send to Governor Healey asking for her support in opposing expansion of private jets and to the major developer of the project, questioning his rationale for supporting such an initiative. 

Feel free to come and share anything you are working on. We all learn from each other!
