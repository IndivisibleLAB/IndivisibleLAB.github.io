Join us for our next Extra Special Action Hour where we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and celebrate our first birthday!!

We will be writing for Activate America’s FIRST Congressional postcard campaign for the 2024 election, Activate America’s top priorities in California: the seats held by Republican Congressmen David Valadao (CA-22), Mike Garcia (CA-27), and Ken Calvert (CA-41). All three voted NO on one of Democrats’ signature accomplishments: the Inflation Reduction Act. Among the many great things the IRA did for everyday Americans, it capped the cost of insulin to just $35 a month for people on Medicare, pressuring major insulin producers to offer that rate to everyone. We are writing to Democratic and Democratic leaning voters who did not vote in 2022. Recent polling indicates many people of all ages are concerned about the cost of insulin in particular and prescription drugs in general. We are also using social pressure messaging based on voter participation research.
Each packet will contain everything that you need to write 25 postcards (Cards, stamps, printed labels, and instructions.) Mailing date is three weeks after you receive your packet. Reimbursement is $15. Please [RSVP](https://mobilize.us/s/R9OsQ6) and let us know how many packets we should reserve.

Meet us at Via Lago in Lexington Center. Feel free to bring a friend, just stop by to say hello, or pickup postcard packets even if you can’t stay.
