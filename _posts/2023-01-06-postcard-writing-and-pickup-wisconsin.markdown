In the swingiest of swing states, Wisconsin, an important upcoming election will determine the balance of power in the state’s divided 4-3 Supreme Court. Vital decisions on abortion rights, election rules, unions, and so much more are on the line. We’re excited to send postcards from Activate America to turn out Democrats who will side with democracy and decency in this election.

This is a critical election. One of the worst Supreme Court justices in Wisconsin, someone who has repeatedly sided against ballot access, is retiring, and we have the chance to replace her with a justice who cares about free and fair elections.

Packets contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (including stamps, instructions, and address labels); the cost is $15. Mail by date is January 26. 

Meet us at Via Lago in Lexington Center. Feel free to bring a friend, just stop by to say hello, or pickup postcard packets even if you can’t stay. 

Please sign up and let us know how many packets we should reserve [here](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/546822/).
