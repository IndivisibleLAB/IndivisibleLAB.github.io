Join us for our Fall Action Hours which will be held at an indoor location in Lexington near Route 2. As usual, we will discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. 

On October 30, we’ll hear from one of our state senators about health care and other bills including what’s been passed this legislative session, what might happen in the next two months before the session ends, and what her priorities are for the new session that begins in January. 

We’ve distributed the last of our postcard packets for this election season - thank you to our democracy writers who sent more than 10,000 postcards this year!

We all learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on! Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve.
