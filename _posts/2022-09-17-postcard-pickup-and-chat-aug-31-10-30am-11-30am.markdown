Meet us outside at the visitor center in Lexington. Feel free to bring a friend, just stop by to say hello, or pickup postcard packets even if you can’t stay. You’ll find us on the porch in the back or at the picnic tables in front (depending on weather). We spread out tables but feel free to bring a mask; we can also create a mask-only table if there is demand.

This week, we'll be writing pro-choice postcards for John Fetterman (PA). With Republican Senator Pat Toomey retiring, Pennsylvania is home to what is arguably the most competitive Senate contest in America. It’s a contest between the state’s popular Democratic Lieutenant Governor, John Fetterman, and Dr. Oz, a Republican, out-of-touch TV personality from New Jersey. John Fetterman isn’t exactly a candidate molded from the West Wing, and Pennsylvania voters like it that way. Fetterman is gruff, no nonsense, and ready to fight for forgotten Pennsylvanians.

These postcards are going to pro-choice Democrats who sometimes skip midterm elections. The script uses research-based messaging approved by Planned Parenthood Action Fund and other local organizations to help get out the vote.

The packets contain everything you need to send 25 postcards. You can mail as you go; the deadline for mailing is October 25th. The price of the packet is $15.

If you want a drink or snack, check out Via Lago, which is just across Meriam Street. There is parking on the street or in the lot on Meriam Street. There is a water refill station inside the Visitor Center so bring your own water bottle!

Can't join us this time? We'll be having similar events every other Wednesday at the same time and location through October.
