Meet us outside at the visitor center in Lexington. Feel free to bring a friend, just stop by to say hello, or pickup postcard packets even if you can’t stay. You’ll find us on the porch in the back or at the picnic tables in front (depending on weather). We spread out tables but feel free to bring a mask; we can also create a mask-only table if there is demand.

We'll post more info about the postcards we'll be writing and a link to reserve postcard packets as soon as the details are available.

If you want a drink or snack, check out Via Lago, which is just across Meriam Street. There is parking on the street or in the lot on Meriam Street. There is a water refill station inside the Visitor Center so bring your own water bottle!

Can't join us this time? We'll be having similar events every other Wednesday at the same time and location through October.
