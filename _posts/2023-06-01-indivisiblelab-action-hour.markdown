Join us for our next Action Hour at Via Lago, where we will write for NY-4, "represented" in the US House of Representatives by Republican Congressman Anthony D'Esposito - One of Indivisible's target "Unrepresentatives" in a Biden-won district. Retired detective D’Esposito has faced multiple sanctions in NY, including for putting family members on the public payroll at taxpayers’ expense. He was handpicked by Kevin McCarthy for committee assignments and is a reliable MAGA vote, despite coming from a Biden district. Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (Cards, stamps, printed labels, and instructions.) The mailing date is three weeks after you receive your packet. Reimbursement is $15. Please RSVP and let us know how many packets we should reserve.

We will also be discussing current local and MA issues and events. Please feel free to come and share any issues you are working on. We all learn from each other! Please RSVP so that we know that you are coming and we have packets available for people that want them: https://mobilize.us/s/HIeWlj
