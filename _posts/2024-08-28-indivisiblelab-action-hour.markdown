Join us for our Fall Action Hours which will be held at an indoor location in Lexington near Route 2. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets and discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy.

We'll be announcing the postcard campaign and any speakers for our October 2 Action Hour here about a week before the meeting. 

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve.

We all learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!
