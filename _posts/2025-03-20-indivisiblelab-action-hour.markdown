Join us for our Spring Action Hours at our new location in Lexington Center. As usual, we'll discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. 

These days, demands for our attention, time and energy can be overwhelming. On April 2, Indivisible LAB member Pat Touzin, a clinical social worker, will teach keys to balanced engagement and techniques for consciously renewing our energy while we support the causes that are important to us. The focus will be on understanding and befriending your nervous system so that you can manage stress and build resilience during these times. Pat has taught many courses on stress management, resilience, mindfulness, communication and leadership and served as Director of the Boston College Faculty and Staff Assistance Program for 38 years.

And if you’re free to stay past 11:30, join us immediately after the Action Hour to make signs for upcoming protests and standouts. We’ll supply the materials!

Please RSVP to get location details and parking information. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on - we all learn from each other!
