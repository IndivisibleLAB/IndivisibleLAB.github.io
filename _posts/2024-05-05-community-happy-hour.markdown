Looking ahead to November, we need to build our resilience! So, join us for our first community happy hour where you can connect with others, have fun, and build community. This month we will be at Burton's Grill in Burlington. Thanks to Indivisible National, IndivisibleLAB will supply the appetizers / small plates. Attendees will be responsible for their own drinks. This event is just social - no speakers and no postcards! RSVP [here](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/630370/)
