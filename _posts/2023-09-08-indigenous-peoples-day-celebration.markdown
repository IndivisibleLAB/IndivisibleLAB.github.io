Join us for a multi-town celebration of Indigenous Peoples Day! This free event for all ages will feature a fun and educational performance by the Mashpee Wampanoag Red Hawk Singers and Dancers. Through song, dance, and teachings, the Red Hawk Singers and Dancers promote traditional Wampanoag values such as humility and respect to create true connections between diverse cultures and communities. This year’s IPD celebration will also highlight the work of local artisans Claudia Fox Tree (Arawak/Yurumein) of [Arawak Design](http://arawak-design.blogspot.com/) and Xochi Kountz of [Crafts for Justice](https://craftsforjustice.square.site/). Event co-sponsors, including IndivisibleLAB, will host informational tables to share the work they do.
 
The program will take place on the central quad at Middlesex Community College, Springs Rd., in Bedford. Plenty of free parking is available. Bring your own chairs/blankets for seating. In the event of rain, festivities will be held in the nearby East Café. For more information, contact PDCBedfordBHS@gmail.com.
