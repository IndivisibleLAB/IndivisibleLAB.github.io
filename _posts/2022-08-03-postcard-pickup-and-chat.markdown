This time, in collaboration with Swing Blue Alliance (SBA), we will be writing for a PA vote by mail (VBM) project. This project, which involves letters rather than postcards, is research-based and shown to work! In 2020, SBA had a project in Bucks County, PA, where letters were sent to Democrats with low propensity for voting. The letters contained pre-addressed VBM application materials, so all voters had to do was to fill the applications out and mail them. Careful research showed that turnout from this effort was much higher than usual for postcard projects! Packets everything you need to write 25 letters and the cost is $25.
