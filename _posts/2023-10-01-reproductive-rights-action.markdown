Indivisible Mass Coalition’s Feminist Action Team is asking people to send postcards or emails to their State Senator and State Representative to ask that they support *An Act Enhancing Abortion Access* [S.1114](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/SD1854)/[H.1599](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/H1599). This legislation targets the [deceptive practices](https://indivisible-ma.org/abortion-access-act/) of the more than 30 anti-abortion [“Crisis Pregnancy Centers”](https://msmagazine.com/2023/08/08/fake-abortion-clinics-crisis-pregnancy-centers/) in MA. Learn more about the work MA Indivisible groups are doing to expose these fake clinics [HERE](https://indivisible-ma.org/a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothing/).

We’ll have postcards at our Action Hours every other Wednesday at 10:30. If you can’t attend an Action Hour, please email or use your own postcards to contact your state legislators. Some of our state reps (Cataldo, Ciccolo, Gentile, Stanley) have already signed on to co-sponsor H.1599, but Senators Barrett, Eldridge, and Friedman have not co-sponsored the Senate bill. Get more info and a sample script [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUPSQ5I9AS-Umcg5P3N-EcUxoCCK2JeIFlNhJJ4dx6w/edit?usp=sharing).
