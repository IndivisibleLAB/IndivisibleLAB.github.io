IndivisibleLAB is proud to co-sponsor this rally hosted by our friends at Concord Indivisible, one of more than 100 being held nationwide, including [13 here in Massachusetts](https://mcusercontent.com/448f2617a0ea6d2c20e5c403c/files/3f6d4b2a-efa6-0612-ef3f-2d73dfc7c0b6/Event_Locations_5_.pdf), on the second anniversary of the Supreme Court Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. 

Our theme is “Bigger Than Dobbs”  because we want the public to know that Republican’s Project 2025 includes nationwide abortion and contraception bans - but also that abortion is just the “tip of the iceberg” and Republicans are trying to “turn back the clock” in other ways.
