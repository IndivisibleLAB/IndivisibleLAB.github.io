Let's help the wildlife - take action! There is a lot going on in the fight against SGARs - at the local level, the state level, and even some at the federal level. There are numerous actions that you can take to help with the SGARs problem. Some of the more important ones are supporting local groups that are getting started and contacting your state representative and state senator to support the following bills: H.825/S.487, H.814/S.540, H.804. and S.2448.
