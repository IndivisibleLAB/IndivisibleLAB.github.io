Let's help the wildlife - take action! There is a lot going on in the fight against SGARs - at the local level, the state level, and even some at the federal level. There are numerous actions that you can take to help with the SGARs problem.  In addition to the bills at the State House (i.e. H.825/S.487, H.814/S.540, H.804, and S.2448), there are lots of cities and towns that have started working on this issue in their town.
