Join us for our Spring Action Hours at our new location in Lexington Center. As usual, we'll discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. 

At our Action Hour on April 30, weâ€™ll hear from Deb Paul who will talk about her roles as the [Indivisible Mass Coalition](https://indivisible-ma.org/) Chair and CD5 Coordinating Board Representative and what it took to organize the Hands Off! Rally in Boston on April 5th.

Please RSVP to get location details and parking information. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on - we all learn from each other!
