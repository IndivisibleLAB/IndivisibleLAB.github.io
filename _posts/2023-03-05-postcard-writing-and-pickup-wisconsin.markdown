Join us for our next Action Hour where we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and write to our legislators.

In collaboration with Swing Blue Alliance, we will be writing to increase turnout in the April 4 WI judicial election, where we are supporting liberal Judge Janet Protasiewicz. She is a champion for abortion rights and will vote against the gerrymandering that has left Republicans in control of the legislature. She will also fight against subversion of the 2024 presidential election, as was attempted in 2020 and failed by only one Supreme Court vote!

This project is aimed at prochoice WI voters at high risk not to vote (“low propensity”). Targeting this group is proven to be the most effective way to increase turnout.

The script is short, it is mail as you go, and has a deadline of March 17th.

Each packet will contain everything that you need to write 25 postcards. It even has pre-printed address labels! The price is $15.
Please [RSVP](https://mobilize.us/s/PleOWn) and let us know how many packets we should reserve.

Meet us at Via Lago in Lexington Center. Feel free to bring a friend, just stop by to say hello, or pickup postcard packets even if you can’t stay.
