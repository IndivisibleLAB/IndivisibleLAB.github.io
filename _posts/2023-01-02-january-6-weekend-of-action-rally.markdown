Rally with us outside First Parish Church in Concord to hear calls to action from key community leaders. Congresswoman Katherine Clark, MA ACLU Executive  Director Carol Rose, State Senator Michael Barrett and others will address the significance of the January 6 insurrection and call for action to protect voting rights and keep our democracy safe. Participants will have the chance to sign a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice demanding follow-through on criminal referrals from the House January 6 Committee.
