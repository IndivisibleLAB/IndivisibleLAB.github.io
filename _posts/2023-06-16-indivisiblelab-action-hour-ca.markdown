Join us for our next Action Hour at Via Lago, where we will distribute postcard packets for CA-22, "represented" in the US House of Representatives by Republican Congressman David Valadao - one of Indivisible's target Unrepresentatives in a Biden-won district. This new campaign will focus on gun safety. Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (cards, stamps, printed labels, and instructions.) The mailing date is three weeks after you receive your packet. Reimbursement is $15. Please [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblelab/event/568075/) and let us know that you are coming and how many packets we should reserve.

We will also be discussing potential ballot questions in MA for 2024, telling stories from recent lobby days at the State House, and sharing some upcoming events. Please feel free to come and share any issues you are working on. We all learn from each other.
