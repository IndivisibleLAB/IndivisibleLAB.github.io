This summer we will be holding our Action Hours on the patio behind the Lexington Visitor Center. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!

This week, a local teacher will discuss Question 2 on this November’s ballot which would repeal the requirement that students must pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) exam to graduate high school. 

We’ll also have postcards to encourage likely Democrats in Arizona Legislative District 27 to register and vote for Democrats like Kamala Harris and [Deborah Howard](https://www.deborahhowardaz.com/), a Democrat running in an AZ State two-seat legislative district with two Republicans. Turning out voters in this district will also help with close elections for the US Senate and the Presidency.

Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (Cards, stamps, addresses, and instructions). Reimbursement is $15 and cards should be mailed by Sept. 16 at the latest. Get more details (including the script and pickup options) and [sign up to get packets here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGQe7kA0ay3okly5IAbNpklR5wDdhgiES2vj34O2pFutg_4A/viewform).

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve. In the event of bad weather, we'll notify you about an alternate indoor location.
