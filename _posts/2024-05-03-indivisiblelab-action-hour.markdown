This summer we will be holding our Action Hours on the patio behind the Lexington Visitor Center. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!

This week our special guest will discuss the work that [Sister District MA-RI](https://www.sisterdistrictmari.com/) is doing to elect progressive state legislators in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.

You can also get postcards to encourage likely Democrats in Wisconsin to register and vote for Democrats like Kamala Harris and warn them of draconian measures planned by the Trump/MAGA radicals in Project 2025.

We need Wisconsin to win the presidency and keep the Senate under Democratic control. Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (Cards, stamps, printed labels, and instructions). Reimbursement is $15. Get more details and [sign up for postcard packets here by Monday, August 5](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJEfILz4tPD9zfOE4W7TawVKG7DvBR-cLs2Q_vzIBD55RGzQ/viewform).

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve. In the event of bad weather, we'll notify you about an alternate indoor location.
