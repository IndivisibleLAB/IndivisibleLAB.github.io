This summer we will be holding our Action Hours on the patio behind the Lexington Visitor Center. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!

Weâ€™ll be announcing our next postcard campaign here and in our email newsletter about a week in advance.

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve. In the event of bad weather, we'll notify you about an alternate indoor location.
