This summer we will be holding our Action Hours on the patio behind the Lexington Visitor Center. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!

This week, we will be writing postcards to Montana. Help re-elect Montana Senator Jon Tester by writing to infrequently voting and newly registered Democrats, highlighting the Senator’s work to lower the cost of insulin and inhalers. This seat is crucial to control of the U.S. Senate. 

Each packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (Cards, stamps, printed labels, and instructions). Reimbursement is $15. [Get more details and sign up for packets by noon on Sunday, July 21, here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYz-dRGiXXj4-Zti-QpG6xq02znB8ca_uVouiRUcbRyf2sSQ/viewform).

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve. In the event of bad weather, we'll notify you about an alternate indoor location.
