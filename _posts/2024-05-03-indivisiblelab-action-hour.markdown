This summer we will be holding our Action Hours on the patio behind the Lexington Visitor Center. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!

This week, we are writing postcards to Pennsylvania! The postcards have a reproductive rights message and are going to registered Democrats and persuadable Independent and unaffiliated voters in PA-07 to encourage them to re-elect Congresswoman [Susan Wild](https://wildforcongress.com/). PA-07 is rated a tossup by Cook Political, and getting out our voters in this battleground state will likely help Dems up and down the ballot. You can review the script and writing instructions [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10jmPq7dhLmECWzUA-5zghvzR18oz5pNS/view). 

Reimbursement is $15 for a packet of 25 cards, stamps, printed labels, and instructions. Please pay at pickup. Reserve your postcard packets by noon on Sunday, July 7 [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1CphAd-W9i_b6Qsrzc5XRRH5DpdraCfaSmfyk1XxIfSFWRQ/viewform). 

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve. In the event of bad weather, we'll notify you about an alternate indoor location.
