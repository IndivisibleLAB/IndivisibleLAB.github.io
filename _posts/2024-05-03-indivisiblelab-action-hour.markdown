This summer we will be holding our Action Hours on the patio behind the Lexington Visitor Center. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets, discuss current events, and learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!

At this week’s Action Hour, we’ll be writing postcards to likely Democrats in Nevada. In 2020, Biden narrowly won Nevada by 2.4 points, but now Trump leads among young voters and Hispanic voters. Get more details about the postcard campaign and sign up for postcard packets [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc36YL-FpB6NssNeRP62AoEdxefG-VB5uX8bfjWVPy-tkanuw/viewform).

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve. In the event of bad weather, we'll notify you about an alternate indoor location.
