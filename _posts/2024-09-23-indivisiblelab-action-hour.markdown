Join us for our Fall Action Hours which will be held at an indoor location in Lexington near Route 2. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets and discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. 

On October 16, we’ll hear from local climate activists about why Massachusetts needs a comprehensive climate bill, what should be in it, and how we can get it passed. 

 We have two postcard campaigns this week with smaller packets since postcards need to be mailed soon: one to get out the vote in Arizona and another to voters in CA-45, one of  Indivisible National’s “Unrepresentative” districts. 

Each packet will contain everything you need to write 15 postcards (cards, stamps, addresses, and instructions). Reimbursement is $10. Get more details (including mail-by dates, links to scripts, and multiple pickup options) and sign up for packets by October 14 [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIgzgUpZYF-lRiY0VW_3uawDVFwTBnEICsgLStmjUCknvI7g/viewform).

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve.

We all learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!
