Join us for our Fall Action Hours which will be held at an indoor location in Lexington near Route 2. As usual, we will distribute postcard packets and discuss current events and actions you can take to strengthen our democracy. 

On October 2nd, we’ll learn about an app that lets you easily share information about Kamala Harris and Tim Walz with friends and family and also hear about canvassing in NH. Please make sure to bring your cell phones!

We currently have two postcard campaigns: one to encourage likely Democrats in the important swing state of Michigan to vote and a bonus campaign from Indivisible National to encourage inconsistent voters who haven’t voted recently to vote this year.

Each MI packet will contain everything you need to write 25 postcards (cards, stamps, addresses, and instructions). Reimbursement is $15. You can also get a packet for the bonus campaign while supplies last. Since we have been subsidizing the cost of regular packets, we would appreciate a voluntary donation of $5 for the bonus packets.

Get more details (including mail-by dates, links to scripts, and multiple pickup options) and sign up for packets by September 30 [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeC1pzFdWj_1AGGJKBAFSwOcweAbyi-9Hv2ZFL3RdU7aYa-Zw/viewform).

Please RSVP so that we know to expect you and how many postcard packets to reserve.

We all learn from each other. Feel free to come and share anything you are working on!
